# 2D Shapes
A WIP graphics API for drawing 2D shapes with triangles, for [Libdragon](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon/tree/preview)


## Building
- `sh ./build.sh` makes both`c` and `cpp`
- `sh ./build.sh clean` cleans both`c` and `cpp` 
- `sh ./build.sh c` makes `c`
- `sh ./build.sh cpp` makes `cpp`
- `sh ./build.sh clean_c` cleans `c`
- `sh ./build.sh clean_cpp` cleans `cpp`

## Notes
- C++ version works fine.
- C version compiles, but boots to a black screen, mostly due to memory allocation memes.
